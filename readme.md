# Personality Test

> Without any Framework, am trying to wire up a minimalistic personality test in golang, this test would have just two questions and based on the results and calculations returned by the system would tell the user if he/she is an introvert or not

## Architecture

> Am trying to implement a Service Oriented Architecture :+1: using the MVC paradigm to create this open source project. Trying to make each function standalone and simple, hence the root of the project only carries the routes call that would initialize everything from DB setup to services and controllers.

```
routes.Routes()

```
